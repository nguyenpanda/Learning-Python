# Casting of variable:


# Definition:
"""
# Casting (Programming):
    In programming, the conversion of one data type into another; for example, from an integer to a string or vice versa. 
    The casting statement in the source code of a program causes the compiler to generate the machine code that performs the actual conversion. 
    See data type, integer and string.
