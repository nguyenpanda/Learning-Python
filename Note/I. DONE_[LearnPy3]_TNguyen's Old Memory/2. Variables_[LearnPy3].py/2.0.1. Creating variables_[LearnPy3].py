# Creating variables:


# Assignment operator, denoted by the "=" symbol
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

print("---Next part---")
# Next part is the replace of variables

z = 1               # The z valurible is a integer which equal 1
z = "Hà Tường Nguyên" # Because next commend is a string assignment
                    # So the int(1) is replaced by a str(Ha Tuong Nguyen)
print(z)


# Result:
"""
5
John
---Next part---
